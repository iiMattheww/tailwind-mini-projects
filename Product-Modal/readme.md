# Product Modal

A product detail modal UI built with Tailwind CSS. The example shows a centered modal with product imagery, actions, and iconography.

## Preview

## How to view

Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder and navigate to `/Product-Modal/`:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/Product-Modal/
```

## Notes

- Uses the Tailwind browser bundle via CDN. For production use, integrate Tailwind locally and optimize assets.
- The modal is presentational; the example does not include focus trapping or keyboard handling â€” add those for accessibility in real apps.
