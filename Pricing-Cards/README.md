# Pricing Cards

A simple responsive pricing cards layout built with Tailwind CSS. Demonstrates card grouping, responsive stacking, and utility-first spacing/typography.

## How to view

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/Pricing-Cards/
```

## Notes

- Uses Tailwind browser bundle from CDN. For production, integrate Tailwind locally and enable purging.
